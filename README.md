[Ostwald Ripening Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostwald_ripening) Written in C++ 

Ostwald Ripening is a physical phenomenon observed in solutions that governs the size of precipitating crystals in a solution. The driving force behind this process is that molecules on the interior of a crystal are more energetically favorable than those on the surface. Molecules in the bulk crystal are completely bonded, but those on the surface are missing a portion of their neighbors and are thus less energetically desirable. When applied on a macroscopic scale, larger crystal particles are more stable than smaller particles since more molecules are maintained on the interior. [A smaller particle will eventually dissolve because the system will lower its energy by diffusing surface molecules into the solution](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-04884-9).

Process is very useful in batch crystalization
